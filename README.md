## How It Works

Rock Cloner V2 uses the official **Discord Bot API** to replicate server structure safely.  
It does **not** use user tokens or selfbot APIs ‚Äî only bot accounts.

When cloning:
1. The bot fetches data from the source server using read permissions.  
2. It creates matching roles, categories, and channels in the destination server.  
3. If enabled, it downloads all emojis and re-uploads them.  
4. Finally, it logs the cloning summary in the application window.

All operations respect Discord rate limits and API safety measures.

## How to Use

1. **Download** the latest Rock Cloner V2 ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/devrock07/rock-cloner/releases/tag/2.0).  
2. **Extract** the ZIP anywhere on your computer.  
3. Open the extracted folder and **run `main.exe`**.  
4. Enter your **Discord Bot Token**.  
5. Input:
   - **Source Server ID** ‚Äî the server you want to clone.  
   - **Destination Server ID** ‚Äî the server to clone into.  
6. Select your desired clone options (roles, channels, emojis, icon, etc.).  
7. Click **Start Clone** ‚Äî Rock Cloner V2 will do the rest.

## Notes

- You must **add the bot** to both servers (source & destination).  
- The bot must have the following **permissions**:
  - `Manage Roles`  
  - `Manage Channels`  
  - `Manage Emojis and Stickers`  
  - `Manage Server`  
  - `Read Messages / Message History`  

- Designed for:
  - **Windows 10/11 (x64)**  
  - No external dependencies or Python required  
  - Runs entirely offline once initialized

## Performance

| Operation | Average Time |
|------------|---------------|
| Role Cloning | 1‚Äì3 seconds (per role) |
| Channel Cloning | 1‚Äì5 seconds (per category) |
| Emoji Upload | 3‚Äì8 seconds (per emoji, based on size) |
| Total Server Clone | 30 seconds ‚Äì 2 minutes (average) |

Performance may vary depending on server size, network, and API rate limits.
